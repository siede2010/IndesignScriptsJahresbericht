 Hello there. id like to just say a few things about some scripts.
 1. listMain.jsx
   That one is used to generate the pages where student & teacher portraits & so on exist.
   They need 2 - 4 things depending on if the option
   1. Folder of all Portraits.
   2. .csv file containing all Student data of what class they belong too and so on.
   3. a .csv file containing all the Student's saying as to what they want to be written underneath their portrait.
   4. a Folder containing all the Placeholders.

 2. testingGrounds.jsx
   Its a simple programm to look through the document. its rather simple but works as a debugger.

 3. wow.jsx
